This is my version of the **[42](https://www.42.us.org/)** cadet project `21sh`. `21sh` is a group project, and I (**mtaylor**) did this project with **[callen](https://github.com/MrChafeits)**. Credit to him where it is due.

# 21sh
The second version of **[minishell](https://github.com/motaylormo/minishell)**, with more features.
